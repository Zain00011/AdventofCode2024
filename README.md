🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! 🎉 In this repo, I’ll be solving daily challenges from Advent of Code and sharing my solutions. Each day's folder contains the problem description, input file, and solution.

📁 Folder Structure
Each day will have its own folder with the following structure:

├── day01/
│ ├── problem.txt # Problem description for Day 1
│ ├── input.txt # Input data used for testing Day 1
│ └── solution.py # Python solution for Day 1
├── day02/
│ ├── problem.txt # Problem description for Day 2
│ ├── input.txt # Input data used for testing Day 2
│ └── solution.py # Python solution for Day 2
└── ...

🧑‍💻 How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the dayX folder (where X is the day number) to view:
problem.txt: The problem statement for the day.
input.txt: The input data used to solve the problem.
solution.py: The Python code solving the problem.
Run the solution.py in your preferred programming environment.
Check input.txt for the input used in the solution.
⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍 (Main language for solutions)
And other languages as needed based on the challenge!
📜 Day-by-Day Updates
Each day, I will add a new folder containing the problem, input, and my solution. Stay tuned for updates as I tackle the challenges! 🎁
